# Note Taker

## Description

-As the world is getting digitiliged, but the people are still using paper notes. So this gave me an inspiration to develop a digitiliged note taker application.

-To achieve my goal, I created this application. In this application you can type in the contents, and it will make the notes for you.

-It gave me a sigh of relief, as it will contribute toward making the earth greener. Though it will be a small initiative but it will definitely contribute towards a greener earth.

-Java script was totally new to me, so I learned them and used it in a way which enhances my understanding of them.
